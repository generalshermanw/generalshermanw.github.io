<p>Hello to everyone—the board and directors of Budweiser for this particular study. The following analysis includes my team’s exploratory data analysis (EDA) and our key findings related to your questions on the Beers and Breweries data sets. The primary focus of this EDA was the relationship between alcohol by volume (ABV), international bitterness units (IBU), and classification of ales as either IPA or some other type of Ale.</p>

<p>We can see that there is a positive correlation between IBU and ABV. We can see a big cluster around 5% ABV, and we predict that these are regular 12 ounces of beers which, according to NIAAA in the U.S., contain between 4-7% ABV, with the average being 5%. Anything above estimates to be malt liquor which averages to be 7% ABV. Just based on this we couldn’t determine the causation, so we decided to compare by Ale and IPAs. We can see that the majority of Ales have low ABV and IBU while the majority of IPAs have high ABV and IBU. Budweiser has average 5% ABV and 7 IBU; therefore, we may carefully suggest focusing on products with ABVs within range of 5.6 to 5.8% and IBUs of 19 to 64. This range might be more competitive in the existing market.</p>

<p>We decided to use KNN classification for our approach. From external cross-validations, the optimal number of nearest neighbors is 37. From this, we checked our accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of predicting IPA versus non-IPA ales. The accuracy for predicting IPA with internal cross-validation based on ABV and IBU was found to be 83.83%, the specificity was 80.95%, and the sensitivity was 75.86%.</p>

<p>Above, we can see a depiction of majority preference by state for certain styles of beers. When ties occurred, we gave the win to the most prevalent beer-type nationally. The focus of our analysis here was to present a by-state retail option. With additional supply-chain information, we may be able to help optimize future distribution or optimization efforts.</p>
